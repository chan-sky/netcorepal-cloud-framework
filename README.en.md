A `tactical` framework for `Domain-Driven Design` based on `ASP.NET Core`.

Core features:

+ Domain-Driven Design practice support
+ CQRS
+ Event Driven
+ Distributed transactions (eventual consistency of event handling)
+ Multi-tenant
+ Multi-environment (canary release)
+ Database and Table Sharding

## How to use

### Using the template tool

Create a project using the `NetCorePal.Template` template tool:

```cmd
# Install the template tool
dotnet new -i NetCorePal.Template
# Create a project
dotnet new netcorepal-web -n My.Project.Name
```

Template tool source code: <https://github.com/netcorepal/netcorepal-cloud-template>

## Vision

With the development of the .NET technology ecosystem, its microservice architecture in the cloud-native era has become very mature, and the implementation of Domain-Driven Design has also received very good support. At the same time, with the increasing demand for informatization and digitalization in various industries, more enterprises and teams are beginning to pay attention to how to effectively organize R&D teams and realize their business architecture.

The core purpose of this project is to help enterprises quickly build a technical implementation framework based on Domain-Driven Design, while accumulating and discussing the methodology of Domain-Driven Design, so that more enterprises and teams can benefit.

## Code Analysis and Visualization

The framework provides powerful code flow analysis and visualization capabilities to help developers intuitively understand component relationships and data flow in DDD architecture.

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

+ **Automatic Code Analysis**: Automatically analyzes code structure through source generators, identifying controllers, commands, aggregate roots, events, and other components
+ **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports various visualization charts including statistics information, architecture overview diagrams, processing flow chart collections, aggregate relation diagram collections, and more
+ **Interactive HTML Visualization**: Generates complete interactive HTML pages with built-in navigation and chart preview features
+ **One-Click Online Editing**: Integrated "View in Mermaid Live" button for one-click jump to online editor

### ðŸ“Š Visualization Examples

**Multi-Chain Comprehensive Chart**:
